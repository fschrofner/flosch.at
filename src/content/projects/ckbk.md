ckbk is a cross platform cookbook application written in HTML5 using the [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/).  
It allows you to add, edit or to delete custom recipes on your local device. To make finding recipes easier, you can search for them using the search bar or filter the recipes based on flags, like "vegetarian" or "glutenfree". You can also filter based on the type of meal, like "lunch", "dinner" or "breakfast".  
When creating a recipe, the different steps and ingredients can be added dynamically by pressing the plus button (see the screenshots) or deleted again by pressing the X button. You can also specify the amount of time the recipe takes for preparation and actual cooking time.  
Internally the application uses a sqlite database to manage the recipes.  
The project was done as part of a university course and never got released. But you can still find the source code below.
