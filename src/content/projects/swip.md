SwiP is an intelligent profile app for Android.  
It's meant to be an open source alternative to well-known apps like LLama and Trigger(though in a much smaller scale at the moment), which still offers some unique features.  

###Profiles
SwiP allows you to create, manage and apply profiles which can contain the following settings:  

####Sound
- Ringer Mode
- Ringtone- & Notification Volume
- Media Volume
- Alarm Volume  

####Connectivity
- GPS
- Mobile Data
- WiFi
- Bluetooth

####Display
- Automatic Brightness
- Brightness
- Display Time Out  

There are also some features which are unfortunately only available for rooted phones like NFC, Airplane Mode and Lockscreen.  

###Triggers
Furthermore the app offers trigger-management. A trigger basically defines a rule for the automatic application of selected profiles.  
The user is able to create said triggers and to use them for his daily workflow.  
A trigger can contain the following rules:

- Location (Geofence)
- Time (Exact time or time range)
- Battery State
- Battery Level (Exact level or level range)
- Headphone State

These rules can be freely combined (e.g. at a certain location AND a certain time).  
The app is currently in a beta stage (all important features are implemented and should basically work, but are not tested on a wide range of devices).
