#About me
I'm a 21 year old  student from Salzburg, Austria.  
At the moment I'm majoring in Mobile Computing at the University of Applied Sciences <a href="http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus/" target="_blank">Hagenberg</a>.  
I am a huge fan of free & open source software, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/FlowingKashmir" target="_blank">music</a> and cooking.  
Even though I was always quite interested in the field of informatics, I just recently decided to make it my profession and enrolled at one of the most reputable universities of Austria.  
Before that I was heavily focusing on Western European languages in <a href="http://www.bgnonntal.at/" target="_blank">grammar school</a>, which gave me some great insights into other cultures and ways of living.  
The languages I've learned include English, French, Italian and Latin (just  mentioned for completeness).  
I hope I will be able to use these skills in my later career.

#About the site  
This website was built with love and a cherry-picked selection of open source tools.  
The CMS behind the site is the slim and slick <a href="http://picocms.org" target="_blank">Pico CMS</a>, which allows me to keep it clean and simple without using a database.  
Responsiveness was done using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation Framework</a>, which was also responsible for the fonts and the buttons.  
<a href="http://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">PrismJS</a> is used for syntax-highlighting and I used some icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.  
The beautiful, responsive lightbox is done using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery" target="_blank">Blueimp Gallery</a>.  
The page was built on my Linux PC using the <a href="http://cherokee-project.com/" target="_blank">Cherokee Webserver</a> and is now hosted on CentOS servers by <a href="https://uberspace.de/" target="_blank">Uberspace</a>.
