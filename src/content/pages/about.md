#About me
I'm a 21 year old  student from Salzburg, Austria.  
At the moment I'm majoring in Mobile Computing at the University of Applied Sciences [Hagenberg](http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus/). 
I am a huge fan of free & open source software, [music](http://www.last.fm/user/FlowingKashmir) and cooking.  
Even though I was always quite interested in the field of informatics, I just recently decided to make it my profession and enrolled at one of the most reputable universities of Austria.  
Before that I was heavily focusing on Western European languages in [grammar school](http://www.bgnonntal.at/), which gave me some great insights into other cultures and ways of living.  
The languages I've learned include English, French, Italian and Latin (just  mentioned for completeness).  
I hope I will be able to use these skills in my later career.

#About the site  
This website was built with love and a cherry-picked selection of open source tools.  
~~The CMS behind the site is the slim and slick [Pico CMS](http://picocms.org)~~ This website was built with the unbelievably flexible [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), which allows me to keep it clean, simple and astonishing fast without using a database.  
Responsiveness was done using the [Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which was also responsible for the fonts and the buttons.  
[PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax-highlighting and I used some icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).  
The beautiful, responsive lightbox is done using [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery).  
The page was built on my Linux PC using the [Cherokee Webserver](http://cherokee-project.com/) and is now hosted on CentOS servers by [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).
