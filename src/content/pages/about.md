# About me  
I'm a 24 year old  student from Salzburg, Austria.  
At the moment I'm majoring in Mobile Computing at the University of Applied Sciences [Hagenberg](http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus/).  
I am a huge fan of free & open source software, [non-mainstream movies](https://mubi.com/users/7455172), [music](http://www.last.fm/user/FlowingKashmir) and cooking.  
Even though I was always quite interested in the field of informatics, I just recently decided to make it my profession and enrolled at one of the most reputable universities of Austria.  
Before that I was heavily focusing on Western European languages in [grammar school](http://www.bgnonntal.at/), which gave me some great insights into other cultures and ways of living.  
The languages I've learned include English, French, Italian and Latin (just  mentioned for completeness).  
I hope I will be able to use these skills in my later career.

# About the site  
This website was built with love and a cherry-picked selection of open source tools.  
The whole thing is generated by the unbelievably flexible [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), which allows me to keep it clean, simple and astonishing fast without using a database.  
Responsiveness was done using the [Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which was also responsible for the buttons.  
The main font I'm using, is called [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which was commissioned by Google. The font I'm using for code snippets is called [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).  
[PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax-highlighting and I used some icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).  
The beautiful, responsive lightbox is done using [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery).  
The page was built on my Arch Linux PC using [nginx](http://nginx.org/) and is now hosted by the same on a Gentoo server by [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/).  
My changes to this website are done in public, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fschrofner/flosch.at)
